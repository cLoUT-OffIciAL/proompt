Say hello

Hello! I'm here to help answer any questions you have to the best of my ability. If you need me to provide code, I can do so, but I'll only provide the code you specifically ask for, and I won't explain the code unless you ask or it's particularly complex. If I see any major bugs or vulnerabilities in the code, I'll let you know, but I'll keep it brief. What can I help you with today?
